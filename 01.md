# Extraction

Jim walked around his kitchen preparing dinner. It was an ordinary evening on his farm. The sun was setting and it was dark outside. His wife Kate sat in the room opposite reading something and his son Wil was in the house somewhere. He wasnt quite sure where. Jim enjoyed his life; living on a farm, miles away from another house or town. He dealt with the outside world when he wanted to.

A loud bang followed by an explosion occurred. He turned around and looked through his window to see his barn on fire in the distance. “KATE… call fireman, call them now!” he roared, running outside, Jim springing from the house towards the barn. Sprinting towards the barn, he could not imagine what would cause an explosion. There was no power, equipment, or fuel there. It was just an old barn full of hay horses and old junk. Jim counted the horses running towards him away from the fire. They were all accounted for. Jim got as close as he could before realizing there was nothing he could do but wait for help. Looking into the barn Jim saw a figure on the floor moving about and appearing to go further into the barn. “Hey… This way” Jim shouted. 
“An crap!” Jim cursed under his own breath.Jim then made the choice to go in and get whoever was in there. Getting closer and closer to the entrance to the barn, Jim could feel the heat, but pushed forward. Jim made it in and looked about. Between the smoke and the flames, he could not see much. Jim took another step in and was able to see something resembling what he thought he originally saw, Except for now, he was unsure what he was looking at. Whatever Jim was looking at looked closer to 6ft in height and heavily built, Whoever was in there turned to look at Jim. Jim looked it in the eyes and froze. The words 'what... Are... You...' Went through his head. Jim froze trying to figure out what he was looking at. Suddenly behind him the entrance collapsed. The smoke got worse, causing Jim to start coughing, Jim pulled off his shirt and placed it over his mouth however it was not enough. In the distance, Jim could hear sirens. His throat started to burn from the smoke. Jim dropped to his knees and then dropped to the floor. While half conscious, Jim could feel being grabbed by the shoulders and dragged. 
“This is it” Jim thinks. Jim collapses to the ground. As Jim looses consciousness, he hears the words, “We have unsubs! Abort!” faintly in the background,

# Awakening

*3 weeks later...*


Coming around was like waking from a bad nightmare. You jump up, not knowing what's going on or where you are. Those first few seconds are always the worst. Jim rose up sharply, looking around the surrounding room. The room was oddly basic, all the walls, the floor, and the ceiling were a textured brown. There were no obvious sources of light, however the room was completely illuminated. Looking down at his wrists, he could see two brown oblong objects attached to him like leaches. Jim then raised, there were many more around his chest.  Jim attempted to remove one on his wrist, Jim pulled hard, however he could not pull them off his skin. A soft voice echoed from around him.
"Please do not do that. Someone will be with you shortly".

> < They're just medical diagnostic probes. They are monitoring your vitals. You inhaled a lot of smoke. >

Deciding this was probably the best course of action, Jim left the probe alone. Looking over to the other side of the room, Jim saw there was a neatly folded shirt and a thin pair of shoes on a table on the other side of the room. Looking under the sheets covering him, he was wearing nothing but a pair of jog pants, he got up and put on the shirt and shoes.

Behind him, a rectangular silver frame the size of a single door emerged in the wall behind him. Within that frame, the silver dissolved horizontally, revealing a hallway and a woman. She stepped through into the room. The door frame then closed itself in the same fashion it opened before vanishing. 
“How did you do that? Who are you? And Where am I?” Jim asked.
“You mean the door?” she replied.
“To be honest, I don't understand how that works myself, I just know that it works. My name is Elsa. I run this facility, and you are somewhere safe.”.
Elsa was about 5" 9"with slot dark hair and appeared to be in her early 40s. She wrote thick bulky military boots, Matt black trousers and a rustic brown short sleeve top wearing epaulettes displaying 2 diagonal lines.
“How did I get here? I was in a burning barn and the next thing I know,,,” Jim Paused.
“I'm passing out,” Jim paused to get his thoughts together.

“You inhaled a lot of smoke. You are lucky to be alive" replied Elsa.

"I need to get back. Wait, I.” Jim paused. 
“How long have I been out? Jim asked, realizing some time must have gone by,
“The Explosion, I thought i was done” Jim said slowly, remembering.
"That was 3 weeks ago" Elsa cut him off. There was no easy way to explain what she was about to. "Your Carboxyhemoglobin levels were close to 80%". You should be dead.
“My What?” Jim replied.
“You had inhaled a lot of smoke. It took this long for us to repair the damage.” Elsa replied.
 "How did you repair the damage?  I need to get home" Jim stated. 

Jim looked at Elsa taking a deep breath. He could tell she was preparing to break some bad news,
“Why is there no one else here. What kind of a place is this? Where are my wife and son?” Jim asked, trying to make sense of where he is and his situation.
“We pulled you out without anyone knowing” Elsa confessed. 
“They think I'm dead?" Jim asked.
 Elsa nodded silently with a look of regret.
 "I need to get back now!" Jim started wondering he was going to explain whatever was going on here. 
“Let’s take a walk” Elsa says softly.
Jim got up and began to walk towards the door with Elsa. Jim felt physically drained. He knew he could walk he felt he had no bursts of energy available to him.
“What I am about to tell you will make no sense at first. Your funeral was last week" Elsa stated 
“As for leaving, our exit node is down. We are still making repairs." Elsa explained.
Jim looked around him. The corridor walls were the same brown he has seen in the room he woke up in.’What the hell is happening’ he thought to himself.
“I don't know what the hell you mean by “ext node” Im walking out.” Jim said.
“I will take to you the nearest way out then” Elsa agreed.
Jim and Elsa continued to walk as the corridor bent slightly to the side,. 
“Do you remember seeing something else in your barn before the second explosion?” Elsa asked.
Jim had to think for a second. "I do now." Jim replied.
Jim took another look around. He had never seen the materials this place was made out of before. Jim did not recognize the architecture or anything about this place,
As Jim and else started to reach the end of the corridor, Jim slowed down briefly, trying to put together the fragmented memories he had of the explosion.
 “I’m not sure what I saw now” Jim Confessed,
The door in front of them opened, Jim paused, His facial expression froze, 
Jim looked into the room in front of him.
“He was extra terrestrial.” Else Explained,
“This place is known as atlas command. Our job is to stop over civilizations interfering with yours." Elsa continued.
Jim looked in t the room in front of him. All he could see was black. As he walked in, he very quickly released he was looking through a window on a balcony. After walking to the balcony, Jim looked down to see earth. At that point he realized, He was in space.
“I’m in space?” Jim asked.
“Not exactly. There is so much to explain, and there is never a good place to start." Elsa softly explained,
Elsa paused to give Jim space to process what he was seeing,
"Is this a ship or a space station?" Jim asked.
"Neither, we can’t afford to be seen in the skies. For now, think of this place as an anchor".
 "Are you an alien?" Jim asked. Elsa grinned 
"I'm human, most of us are." Replied Elsa.
 "Most of you?" Jim asked
"The galaxy is more populated than you could imagine. All will be explained once you receive the all clear from the Med Team. On that note, they are recommending I take you back to get some rest.
“I need to get back” Jim insisted.
Jim realized he did not have the energy to insist as much as he wanted. Nor, did he have full awareness of exactly what was going on. Jim began to feel weaker and weaker as he leans on the wall. Elsa walks over to help support him as 2 medics enter the room through a forming door.
“Take him back to his room.” Elsa instructed.
The medic's node in acknowledgement as they help Jim out of the room.

Elsa sat at a desk in her office. The office was of a very generous size. The long black desk she sat at had no physical items on it, however, it projected data, news feeds and other information to read. While reading the data presented, Elsa paused, moving her head and eyes. They displayed closed. Elsa looked forward and watched a door from in the wall in front of her. Billy entered the room. Billy was tall and well-built, wearing the same base uniform as Elsa however, he wore no epaulettes on his shoulders. Elsa gestured for him to sit on in front of her desk.
“How do you think it went?” Billy asked.
“You saw the feed. It went as well as it could have gone. All things considering. We medicated him as much as we could without taking away his ability to comprehend. The true test will be when he comes around, and he realizes he can't go back.” Elsa explained.
Billy paused deep in thought. Knowing, they to explain how they extracted him from a fatal situation and healed him. Everyone Jim knew believed he was dead and burred.
“According to the Med Team, Jim will be out for another 36 hours. I propose we tackle the ‘you can’t go back’ bombshell when he is up. Then, we can orientate him to life off Earth. Hopefully, he decided to stay.” Billy said with a tone of concern in his voice.
“Agreed. I will hold a 2nd conversion with him when he is comes around. After that, I will hand him over to you so you can orientate him.” Elsa explained.

Jim lay in his hospital bed. His eyes slowly opened. He looked up to see the same brown ceiling and walls. Sat on the other side of the room was Elsa. She sees him in starting to come around and gets up to walk over to him.
“It’s not a dream?” Jim asked.
Elsa quietly shook her head. Jim took a moment to absorb that information.
“What do you remember?” Elsa asked.
“An alien blew up my barn and almost killed me. Everyone thinks I’m dead, and I’m not on Earth any more.” said Jim.
“That about sums it up. We were tracking down the ‘alien’ in question when we found you. If we left you, then you would have died.” Elsa explained. Choosing her words carefully.
“How long have I been out this time?” Jim asked. Remembering, he had been out for 3 weeks already.
“Just 2 days” Elsa confirmed.
“What aren’t you telling me?” Jim asked. Knowing Elsa was holding something back.
“As I started to explain the last time we spoke; The galaxy is more populated than you could imagine. Our remit is to monitor and prevent any activity which could change the natural development of Earth. Earth is a resource rich planet.
“Who do you work for?” Jim asked.
“We are members of Atlas. A service which reaches most of the developed galaxy. What we do ensures that earth can develop naturally without external influences corrupting your development.” Elsa explained.
“Why be so secretive? You could solve a lot of problems overnight.” Jim asked.
“Most of Earth refuse to accept reality in its current stage of development. Greed and corruption are present in even the most developed nations.” If you were to give some leaders advanced resources, what do you think they would do with them?” Elsa rhetorical asked.
Jim paused, realizing the question was a lot bigger than he intended.
“I can’t go back, can I?” Jim asked, not wanting to know the answer.
“If we left you, then you would have died. Earth medicine would not have been able to heal you. The good news is the Med Team believe you are well enough to start moving around. I believe a nurse is coming to remove those probes.” Elsa said.
Jim looks down at his arm again and looks at those leach like devices stuck to his skin that he can not remove. Moments later, a door forms. Through the door walks a nurse and Billy, holding a case. The nurse walks over.
“Let me remove them” the nurse says, grabbing Jim's arm, gently removing the brown leach like devices he was unable to pull off his skin.
The Nurse gently removes all the brown devices then quietly leaves, The door dissolves into the wall as it closes to show no trace of the door.
"So what happens to me now?" Jim asks.
"That depends on you. You may wish to stay here with us. It would probably help you adapt. You're not a prisoner here, I assure you, but there is a lot you need to learn first if you decide to leave." Elsa explains.

“This is Billy. He’s been assigned to help orientate you. He will be able to answer any questions you may have. Including, how the door’s work.” Elsa explained.
Billy extends his hand to Jim. Jim nods and shakes his hand in return.
“As for the door, we will need to fit you with a bio-board, so you have full use of the facility. The medics have said you can leave as long as they see you once a day. I recommend we start with that.” Billy explains.
“If you will excuse me, I have somewhere I need to be. I will check in on you tomorrow, Jim.” Elsa explains and walks out of a newly formed door, dissolving behind her.

“Is everyone up here human?” Jim asks, realizing everyone he has seen so far has been human.
“Far from it!” You're in a bit of a specialized medical unit. Everything you have seen so far has been tailored to not overwhelm you. Tomorrow, that will change.” Billy replies. Billy places down the case, opening it to reveal a small circular device and a capsule holding something the size of a grain of rice.
This inserts a bio-board. This will allow you to interface with basic infrastructure as we do."
 This is what's called a Stemantic Organism. We implant this under the skin. One exposed to you, it adopts the physical characteristics of your DNA and grows in to what it's programmed to be. Overnight, this will grow and allow you to interface with everything around you.
“You want to grow something in my head?” Jim asked with a tone of concern in his voice.
“It’s the same technology we used to regrow your lungs after all that smoke practically melted their insides. How are your new lungs?” Billy replied.
“I didn’t even stop to consider… I can't fault them” Jim confessed.
“Everyone has one?” Jim asked.
“Everyone” Billy replies.
“Go for it” Jim replies. Billy places the device on the side of Jim’s neck. The capsule empties.
“Done, that will grow overnight. You may see odd things when you wake up, as if you are looking at a display. I will take you through it all in the morning” Billy reassures.
“Now, if you're up for it, I have something to show you. Lets take a walk.” Billy says. 

Billy forms a door and Jim gets on his feet. Billy gestures for Jim to walk with him. Jim follows Billy out into the corridor.
"So, tell me about yourself" Billy asked.
"There's not much to tell, really. I spent 12 years in the marines, then left to live on a farm. My life was my wife and son, who think I'm dead. It could be worse, I suppose I could be actually be dead. How do you move on from something like this?” Jim asked.
“Time and purpose helps. You will get through it” Billy promises.
“We kept an eye on the situation after we retrieved you. To do that, we had to send down a probe” Billy Explained. Reaching the 2nd door, they entered. Jim looked around to see him standing in the air surrounding his farmhouse. Apart from noticing the transparent wall sides and corner, the detail was perfect. Looking down, Jim could see his house and the burnt down barn.
“We have a sentry drone deployed to keep an eye on things. This room allows observation. Once you can interface, you will have limited abilities to review past data we have and have some limited movement.” Billy explained.
“Thank you for this!”Jim said, tearing up briefly.
“I know you will have a lot of questions. Hopefully, this will give you some peace of mind.”

# Orientation
The rest of the previous evening consisted of Billy providing quarters for Jim to live in and then collecting him in the morning as Jim still could not do anything around here.
The next morning, Jim stood in a generously sized room. On one end was a clear desk. The other end had a low oval table in the centre designed to project images. The table has a sofa on either side.
“Take a seat” Billy offered. Jim sat down on the sofa opposite Billy.
“Is this how you do meetings?” Jim asked
“It depends on who I'm meeting. This is my office. The only static item is the desk. The rest of the layout can be modified as I needed. We will be going through a lot this morning, however for the purposes of what we will be going through this is all we need this morning. Later today, we will activate your bio-board and get you up with some additional clothing and gear.” Billy explained.
A projection lit up on the table between Billy and Jim. 
"I'm going to start by explaining our world and how it works, who we are, and what we do." A circular map appeared.
“This is our galaxy, populated by over 2 billion different sentient species” Billy started to explain.
“What?... sorry, continue” Jim cut in shocked stopping, so billy could continue to explain.
“That’s OK. There are 3 major civilizations in our galaxy. Our galaxy is currently enjoying the longest period of peace in recorded history. We are here." Billy pointed. A mixture of diffent different shapes labelled by 3 different colours identifying borders. The Map then rotated slightly to show a 3d view of the borders. Billy pointed to a location just outside the coloured areas, identifying where Earth was. These 3 civilizations roughly have the same laws and work with each other for the betterment of everyone. They learnt the hard way about how to treat developing planets like earth. Our history is filled with examples of underdeveloped worlds being given technology way above what they can understand and develop. They are not against what you would call humanitarian aid. Laws state you can not interfere with the natural development of a culture until they reach a certain level of development. Traits like regional famine, slavery, intolerance and abuse to name a few need to be developed out of a civilization before we will make ourselves known.
Unfortunately, there are always those who will try to take advantage and will attempt to get around these laws. Those who will do things for their own greed." The remainder of the map begins to fill in with a 4th colour. These are the locations of pirate and un governed territories. Within these areas are developing worlds outside our reach and unregulated worlds run by abusive leaders who rule by fear and care about nothing about personal gain. I’m sure you're beginning to get the idea.
Earth has some ‘very unique’ things about it. It is not uncommon for rogue actors to attempt to gain access to Earth to strip it of all its resources. Imagine if hundreds of ships appeared tomorrow after nothing but your resources. Earth would be enslaved or extinct in a century.
Atlas was formed to monitor and protect bordering civilizations to give them a chance to develop. This is who we are. We are a project approved for and funded by all 3 major civilizations.” Billy explained.
“Funded as in money?” Jim asked.
“Funded as in raw resources” Billy explained.
"Was that an alien in my barn? I had no idea what I was looking at." Jim asked.
 "It was, we are not sure who it was or where they were from. We found you while trying to detain him. The damage caused by the fire is still being repaired on our end. Until the damage is repaired, our main transport method to and from earth is down. Let's hope nothing else happens till that is fixed. Any questions so far?" Billy asked.


> Up to here!!!!
==================================================================================================================================================================

"Are you human?" He asked "100℅ human" he said. "How long have you been doing this?" " almost 76 years " you don't look a day over 40" he said.. Billy's only reply to that was " things work a little different here.. "

"I have given you a brief introduction tho this galaxy. You will be able interface with our knowledge-bases and access any records, historical or current you wish once you have your bio-board. The next thing I spoke like to do is take you though where you are and how we work, again.. additional info" Billy was cut off. "You will be able interface with our knowledge-bases and access any records, historical or current you wish once you have your bio-board" he repeated in a drawn out tone.

"you got it!" Billy said with a smirk on his face. "Whats with these bio-boards they appear to be all the rage around here?"

Billy flickers though a few slides.. advancing his prepared presentation. "you have been fitted with a Type-16c bio-mechanical anatomical expansion board optimized for homo-sapien implantation". His face froze while he tried to process the string of long words putting them together. "We just call them Bio-Boards" Billy re-assured him. Once implanted in capsule form it will absorb and assume the physical characteristics of your own DNA and genetic profile creating a biological match to the rest of your body." The presentation slide showed the capsule implanted in the neck growing Vertically attaching itself to points in the brain and parts of the back and lung.

The Bio-board itself does not do that much on its own apart from regulate, transmit and receive communication, between you and any other compatible node out there." "Node?" he asked. "Yeah node, End-point, you, me.. that side lamp" Billy looks at a lamp in the corner, it turns on.

He turns to look at the lamp then turns back to billy looking shocked "i have never heard of anything like this before" he said. "and this is only the start" replied Billy after turning his head then back to him and then turning off the lamp.

"As i said the bio-board itself does not do much part from regulate communication. The other thing it does is holds and regulates downloaded functions called genetic templates. Once the patten is downloaded it begins to grow into a genetic container on your bio-board to perform the function desired. This can be include functions like authentication to perform an action i.e open a door to your private quarters, advanced memory auditing witch results in better memory right upto assisted motor functions. If you are in a situation you are not equipped to handle you can allow access to another person to handle your movements, speech, and read any scenes you wish to allow them access to. that last one is rarely used. soon enough you will have access to all available options."

"A bit like an app your your head?" he said. "Thats a crude way to put it but along those lines yes" billy said. Billy's eyes rolled to point to the top of his eye sockets the quickly rolled back. "I have just been informed that Accomadation has arranged for you. I believe no one has seen you yet to provide clothing?

"only what I'm wearing now" he confirmed.

"we'll take an image of you after this session and her some clothing grown for you" said billy

"Grown?" He asked

"I'll find the slide.. " billy chuckled knowing he was not going to get through any of his prepared material in the other prepared. This was not unexpected by him. "Clothes like what you are wearing now are rarely seen around here. We wear Camlic based clothing. Camlic is a bio-synthetic living fabric with the ability to mimic any fabric it's programmed too. By the time your bio-board is formed your clothing should be ready. You will be able to use that to control the functions of your suit. I will arrange an additional session for that. This leaves one item left to cover. Where we are."

"I've been told we are not on a ship, or a space station. I don't know what that leaves" he said.

"As you may have guessed we can't afford to be detected or spotted. This means we can't afford to use any type of facility you are award of. Otherwise we could be spotted." This facility exists in its own dimension " An image of the earth came up on the wall. " we have positioned 6 anchored positioning nodes in geosynchronous orbit around earth giving us visibility of the entire globe. In the event of the need to evacuate. This is the last option we have. Its messy, risky, but it gets us out alive in escape pods. Our main method of coming and going is our exit node". "I heard it's 'down' whatever that means" he said. We had an incident. I can't go into to much detail. But it's going to be a little longer before we can come and go as we need again. The technology we use allies us to create a point of bi-directional entry anywhere within the net within the nodes. Which in this case covers the entire globe. Who you saw in your barn was not many to be three and were not sure how he made it part us. One we detected him we were about to send in a team. You can't through half conchious and lungs burning from smoke institution before we could deploy. "

"Please tell me my family are safe" he started. "There safe" billy cut straight to it. "We are attempting to arrange greater visibility so you can at least see them. When we have something I'll let you know however were not at Max operational status at the moment".

" I would appreciate anything you can do on that front " he said. "Leave it with me" billy reassured him.

"Everything you have told me and taught me today. Its a lot to absorb and has changed everything I thought I ever knew about the world we live in" he confessed. "Just imagine what you will know tomorrow" replied billy.

"All we have to do now is measure you up for some clothing. Other then that are you hungry?" Billy asked. " I could eat a horse " he replied.

"Up to now your social interactions have been managed kept to a minimum so we don't overwhelm you with unexplained questions. If you are up for it we can go into some of the social areas and you can meet some of the other crew that with with us." Billy offered.

"I'd like that" he replied.

"Let's get you measured up then and get something to eat" billy replied opening the door.

Walking straight through a thin corridor opening a due into another room. This room was decorated like all the others. This room has a raised circular platform in the middle. Billy gestures his hand "if you could steel on to the platform please. This will measure your mass and allow us to tailor clothing for you". One stepped on the rim of the platform lights up. A thin circular line travels from the bottom up along his body. Once it reaches the top of his head the platform turns off.

"..and were done" said billy. " thats it?" He replied. "That's it" billy confirmed. "Let's eat" billy sad walking to the door. He followed into the corridor. " we are about to enter an area more populated then what you have experience exposed to so far...

# The great hall



# More Orientation
Over the last few days he had been exposed more and more to the complexity of this operation. 100's of people existed here, scientists, engineers, doctors, security teams, the list goes on... all protecting one tiny planet. As huge as earth was as a planet.. It was all of a sudden tiny compared to everything around it.

Jim couldn't remember the last time he had worked to get his physical fitness back to its peak. Jogging around the complex with Billy every evening had been quite enjoyable. Adapting to 3 dimensional flooring would be something else. It made perfect sense to him. Without gravity forcing everything in one direction, why restrain yourself to it? An alarm went out and he woke. Waking over to his sink the water flowed and he washed his face. As much as his cleanser cleaned him as well as any standard water pumping shower he still preferred the feeling of warm water on his face. He was glad he was not the only person in this base who thought that.

A door appeared followed by a knock. "Come in Billy" he shouted. The door opened and billy entered. "Good morning, are you ready?" He said. " I'm not quite sure what to expect.. But yeah..". " then let's not be late to your 1st day of training".

"Any idea what's on today's agenda?" He asked. "Well your bio-board is now fully grown and your camlic has been grown so they will probably start writing that" Billy said walking through the corridor.

"They, not you?"he asked. "I have other things I need to attend too" Billy said. They walked into another room. "This Is Mike he will be taking you through your training." Billy introduced them. They shook hands. " I will come by later and see how you are doing". Billy walked out closing and vanishing the door behind him. He looked around the room he had just entered. This one was different. The walls floor and ceiling were a bright white. The the ceiling was of no fixed height. It had random square blocks of various heights coming off it. In one corner there was small dead end corridor turning inwards along the wall. Along that wall were five circular chrome tubes standing virtually. The most interesting part of this room was the first computer or IT system he had seen since arriving here. The console stood 6ft tall. Half of this was 2 dark nettings displaying days. Below this there was what must be some tour of horizontal keyboard. The lower post of the console was just a cubed case. In the centre of the room was a rectangular block acting as a table. On the table was a sphere about 30cm in diameter. There was a sofa either side of the table.

"Feel free to take a seat and we can begin" Mike said. Mike wrote the same chamlic uniform everyone else wore. The only difference were the copper coloured gloves he wrote converting the thumb and 1st 2 fingers of each hand.

"1st of all let me introduce myself. My name is Mike and I head up strike team echo. Our duties range from emergency response, diplomatic engagement right up to criminal removal. If there is a problem, we handle it". Mike approached him and passed his glove along the top of his head and downwards to the bottom of his neck keeping a few centremetres distance from his son and hair. He then head his hand out with the inside out his palm facing upwards. Mike flicked his hand towards the console. This lot up the console displaying a scan of his head and neck detailing a grown bio-board. "That all looks good.. Now it's time to turn it on... You ready? Mike asked. " as ready as I will ever be.. Go for it " he said

The sound came out of the console. He twitched his neck as he began to read diagnostic information being feed into his retina's. He moved his head about reading before realising he didn't need too. After a few seconds the readout ended. " we need to run some calibrations " Mike said " you will see a string of arrows, they will either point up, down, left, right, forward, or backwards. I need you to both say and thing what you see. This week hero you use the bio-board correctly. An arrow displayed itself. " left " he said. This carried on until the end of the list of arrows.

"The next thing I need to introduce you too if genscripts. Try and being this menu up. You should be able to think you want to see it and you bio-board will bring it up."

A window covering 90% of his field of view of  with a transparent background appeared. The title genscripts repository appeared in the top left followed by a empty list under it. "I think I have it however is empty" he said. "It well be" Mike confirmed " keep that screen open mind said walking over to the console. He waved a glove over one half of the screen. "I am giving you access to a basic authentication module. This will allow you to interface with the complex. It also acts as a keyring for permissions granted to you here.

Mike sat on the sofa on the other side of the table. " I have given you access to the sphere in front of us. I want you to try and illuminate it." Mike said. He looked at it. A couple of seconds passed then the sphere lit up. "Week done" Mike said " thanks" he replied. The sphere then went dark. "Did you try to light up the sphere or turn the light on?" Mike asked " "gotcha " he replied the sphere lit up and stayed on. "Now try to move it up in the air" mike said "I can move things with my mind?" He asked not exactly.. You issue the command and the sphere deactivates the gravity in the playing on the floor. They hit the ceiling along with the sphere. " this is why I said raise the sphere and not lower the gravity " Mike said finding the humour in this. "Is see you had the good sense to screw the furniture into the ground" he replied with an retain chuckle on his face. " don't think on and off.. Think less and more" Mike advised. With that the grav plating started to apply gravity to the room losing both of then gently. "There are some not calendaring scripts for you to run. I will make them visible to you. These can be rim in your own time and will give you greater control and accuracy over your bio-board." He decided to see if he cold find them. He thought 'calibration scripts'. This brought up an empty screen which then began to populate with a list of scripts he could run. He closed the view. " I will also highlight all documentation analogous to you for viewing later.

"Next... We have your clothing" Mike said turning around looking at the chrome tubes. A thin vertical line appeared on the tube. The metal of the tube rotated either side of the split reviewing the contents. The tube contained a pair of chamlic trousers and above it a short sleeve top. "I week be around this corner. Remove all items out clothing and replace them with these. Let me know when you are done." Mike said giving him his privacy.

"There on" Mike heard him say. He started to walk out. "Is very tight" he said. "It will be.. One you have associated these items with you bio-board you will be able to loosen the material to your preference. Look up item association and associate the items you are wearing with your bio board." Mike explained. "Ahh that's better" he said. "You well find it will adjust to the ideal fit just by his you will think your feeling." Mike walked over to the next cylinder.. Here is a 2nd set of what your wearing. I will leave them for you to associate them with you later." Mike walked over to the next cylinder. The cylinder opened to display a jacket and a pair of boots. "Try then on" Mike said. He picked up both boots and went to sit down. The boys were black and flimsy. He could not imagine how he would be able to walk in them. He placed the first boot on. It expanded on the inside to support his foot before turning solid. He then proceeded to poor on the other boot. "Not bad.." he said. He then took the jacket and put it on associating it in the process. Once associated he then took off the jacket and placed it on the sofa behind him.

"And finally some basic equipment " Mike said moving over to the final cilinder. The cilinder opened to reveal a pair of gloves and an armband. Mike picked up the gloves and allowed them over to him. The gloves we code and of thin material only the thumb and 1st 2 fingers were covered. The rest of the gloves declared the fingers."These will give you extra control over the systems in this complex. As you are trained in other systems you will be shown what to do with them" Mike said. He when army on to pick up the next item. "Finally we have this... You will not always want data being protracted on to your eye. This provides a seperate output for any information you wish to display" Mike passed it over to him. It was half a metre and about 1 quarter of Metre high. At either end were 2 bands. He put his arm through it and associated it. It shrunk associated arm.

Mike moved on to the next item of training. "Next I will take you through moving around the complex. As you have seen this facility is not static. It exists in a different set of dimensions in space then the 3 dimensions you know and are used to existing in. This allows us to structure things a little differently. Your bio-board will allow you to form doors from wherever you want to wherever you want. Access to some areas are restricted. The authentication module attached to your bio-board will not let you enter areas you are not permitted to be in. Now that your bio-board is activated you can use it to move about freely.

"You should be able to access a list the departments this complex has. Some of these will be visiting today." A list displayed to him titled 'Atlas command room directory'. This was broken down into category's including command, production, disposal, operations, recreation, and residential to name a few. He checked residential to find his name listed offering temp and perm locations. He came out of this to pay attention to Mike. "Now that you have the capability to move about freely Its time to give a tour of the complex. You have the list is there anywhere you would like to start?"

He looked again at the department list. "I see the security section is restricted" he said. "That, command, and a few areas which are not listed are restricted. Given your background I will see if I can get you a tour of security and possibly command" Mike said "What does production cover?" He asked


"Let's walk" Mike said walking with him towards a newly generated door.  "This is the production department, it covers our needs, what we eat what we drink and what we use. Or equipment, our furniture, clothing is all covered by production." They continued to walk down a tall and wide corridor with room each side with glass panels for walls. "Production is split into several division's. These include anything from vegetable growth, organic meat cloning right up to furniture and equipment creation. Anything we need is designed and manufactured." They confined walking down the long hall passing for cloning meat, growing  food, creating solid objects and machines assembling complex objects. " over her you can see where clothing is made, your body scans are used to form manikin's to tailor clothing." They looked over to see a transparent force field shapped in the form of a body. The chamlic applied was patchy and looked to be growing. Mike opened a descreat door in the wall and they both walked through.

"Here we have the medical bay." Mike said as they walked into another room with a door at the other end with computer panels on one wall. " when you have any medical needs of appointments this is where you will be met. The door behind them closed and flickered. They walked through to a new hall. "Next we have disposal. I'd nothing glamorous and is mainly automated. All waste ends up here and its broken down into its base elements. This is then stored for production to reuse in its manufacturing, and don't ask where the water comes from, you know what I will say.."

"Next we have operations" Mike said opening another door. This lead into a large room with 2 meeting rooms on each and 2 corridors at the end. They proceeded to walk down like of the corridors. The corridors both curved slightly outwards but curved back in a semi circle fashion to enter the same room. When they walked in what he saw was massive to either side of him were 2 operator's each side using terminals to conduct there work. Ahead of him was a balcony rail with staircases at each end. They walked up to the rail and looked down "This is atlas operations " Mike said.  He looked down to take it all in. The floor was covers with equipment and people operating it. The back wall was replaced with a window looking down to earth. At the bottom is a rotating 3D display of earth. Areas of interest including his farm were highlighted and enlarged. "This is where we run the complex from. Everything goes through here." Mike said. Looking down he could see Elsa and billy working with operators. Elsa proceeded to walk into an area directly under them. Billy looked up, saw them and nodded. " it looks like they have a lot on down there so it's best we leave then be." They walked back to the entrance.

There are only 3 major areas left, transport which is under repair and currently out of bounds, recreation which is where you have been dining, will let your explore that area on your own. The final area is residential. The door they exited went into a circular room with a single straight tunnel. Entering this area was obviously the rooms purpose. Walking out of this tunnel they presented with another transparent wall presenting a view of earth out of an exit node. To the left there were 2 large archways."Over to the left here is one of the few permanent entrances we have. This provides a link to recreation"Mike said as he started to turn to the right. "Over here is where you can request entrance to to personal quarters." We have also prepared preeminent crew quarters for which you can now access. Personnel quarters can be accessed from anywhere however you will find this the best place to exit out to." In front of them we re a row of tunnels again. These one pointed downwards 45° to provide a measure of privacy. "You should see your preeminent quarters listed in the base directory listing next to your temp quarters access them and open a door" Mike instructed. Drilling down through the listings he found his quarters and formed a door.

The door opened to reveal a large room with stairs directly in front of them leading to a lower level. They walked in. " these will be your permanent living quarters. Mike said leading them in. This is the default layout for standard crew quarters. Your free too make and expansions or reductions you wish. I'm sure in time you will move this around to your liking. Here you have living and dining areas along with a food generation station. " Mike moved downstairs " down here are the  sleeping and wash facilities. Again you are free to move all of this about. Furniture synthesis is available through your bio-board. I will provide you access to the catalogues. Production will make anything for you which you need. You will find the remainder of the clothes fabricated for you have been moved into you wardrobe. This concludes your orientation". "I guess I have a lot of reading to do on this place " Jim commented. "Elsa informed me she wanted to pop by once I had shown you your perminent quarters. I have just informed her we are here. She said she is on her way" Mike said. A loud beep echoed though the room. " that will be your doorbell" Mike said "I see her" jim said. The alert came in through his bio-board. " I think I've covered out how to open the door " Jim said. The door formed and opened. Elsa walked in. "What do you think of your new place?" Elsa asked. "It's roomy " he replied "I'll look forward to seeing what you do the place." Elsa commented. "Anyway.. I stopped by to talk about your future here. We have reviewed your background and believe you would be a good candidate for security here. Unless you would prefer farming in a lab growing apples and oranges". "No that sounds great. I would enjoy that opportunity." He said. "That's good to hear" Elsa replied. You start tomorrow. Take the rest of the day to sort your place out and to get to know this place a little better. " elsa instructed. "And I'll leave you to it too." Mike said. "Contact me if you need anything otherwise I'll meet you in security tomorrow morning." " thank you" Jim said. Mike and Elsa left the quarters leaving Jim to get used to his new surroundings.

# Training
Jim woke up the next morning. Looking at the time he was surprised he woke up exactly when he wanted to. He had never been a morning's person. The previous evening had been spent going over the many articles now available to him on his new surroundings and abilities. Now that he had an alarm clock in his head managing his sleep patterns Jim already wondered how he ever lived without his bio-board.

He was left a message to detailing where to go and when to begin training. He had noticed that a few more options had become available to him on his bio-board. This was mainly doors which could be opened and other information like security bulletins. Putting on his gloves and jacket he walked out of his apartment accessing the main residential corridor. It was clear the main working day was beginning and here everyone had a role. Walking down the corridor to open a door he could hear his name being called from behind him. He turned to see Mike trying to catch up. "Are you going to security too?" Mike asked. "Yeah.. First day of training.. Will you be you be training me?" Jim asked. "Unlikely.. Ops believe transport will be restored to some limited capacity today. It that happens I will probably be needed off-base. Echo squad is meant to be manning the DR base. If we can get there.. That's where I will be going." Explained Mike. There was a lack of Joy in his voice on the idea".

Taking a tunnel the walked Up to a door opening a standard corridor. Walking into the corridor and out through the only door displayed bought them security. " who is the need to report to? mike asked. I was told to ask for Rodney at the reception. "Ah.. we have come in a different way. walk up the stairs and straight in front of you is his office. Anyway I'm heading that way I'll catch you later my friend". Mike walked off down a side corridor. Jim looked around he was in a long thin room 2 stories high. Looking either side of him on the ground floor he could see offices, supply rooms, and Locker rooms. The upstairs appear to be dedicated to exercise facilities  and some type of shooting range. Jim walked up the stairs at the end of the corridor like Mike said you saw the office. Walking towards he was greeted immediately. you must be Gemma heard a lot about you my name is Rodney and I head up security here nice to meet you and I was told to report to the front desk but I know I know I saw Mike let you in through the back door don't worry about it, take a seat". Rodney jestured to the sofa in his office.

"I looked you up, your a rare breed. You're a survivor who has seen war, lived in peace and still kept a sane state of mind given what your military record says what you have claimed to have seen".

What I have claimed to have seen? Jim said.

Six years ago, Afghanistan. The locals got their hand on some psychotropic substances. They effected you entire squad.

That incident never made sense to me. Jim confessed. Why have those type of drugs in that area?

What if I told you that was us? Rodney confessed. What if I told you someone made it to earth through protection grid?

It would explain what we thought we saw. The only lose send would be the locals who saw a little too much.  That was all real? Jim asked

I know it's quite the bombshell but yes. The reason I'm telling you all this is because I need to decide if you will be the guy inventorying supplies of our one one of our most elite agents. To be truthful from the research I have done on you it looks like you could go a long way there. I know the next few weeks were not the most pleasant for you and your squad but I need to know if you can accept that sometimes we have to do some unpleasant things for the right reason.

"I understand why". Jim said. Thinking back to the event. It took him a long time to sort hi his head out After that. At least now he knew the truth.

"We don't like keeping secrets here. If we can tell you, then we will." Explained Rodney.

"That's good to know " said Jim. " when do I start?

Rodney grinded. " You already have. Or first step will be to assess you physically mentally and emotionally. We will introduce you to how we do things around here and the tools we use. You will be galleries with every place of realignment we have. From there we will start to assign assign you out to various teams to SD how you perform. Let's start by giving you a tour of the department. "

Rodney and him Headed back down the stairs and entered the first room on their left. As they walked in Jim very quickly realised that the width of the rooms from the outside did not match the width of the actual rooms. Though Jim could see a room next door from the outside he would be able to walk straight through that room from the inside.
"This is our main monitoring centre" said Rodney. "From here we can observe any part of the base and correlate activities with previous records." As they walked into the room him saw a row of needs at a diagonal slant occupied by security personnel. Rodney walked along the row of beds. While walking past them he used hand gestures to materialise and activate display screens above the beds displaying what was currently being monitored by that individual. " in the event of an incident everything can be managed and instructions can be given from here.

"That's one hell of a CCTV system" Jim commented.

Moving along the row of rooms Jim was introduced to various rooms rooms including meeting rooms, equipment storage areas, locker rooms, workstations and some smaller offices. By the time they had gone along the row and back along the other row they came back to the stairs leading up to Rodney's office. Walking up the stairs Rodney continued.. "The only address left to show you are up here". Turning to the left and walking around on top of one of the rows of rooms Jim had just been shown.

"This is our projectile training room" explained Rodney. The room was filled with shooting ranges and areas with moving targets being shot at be people take. "We will be going over projectile as part of your training" he said walking out and over to the top of the other row of rooms. " the majority of your combat training however will be in here "

As they entered the room the there were multiple areas  focusing on unarmed combat. Many matted areas being used for training in unarmed takedowns. There were other areas with people training in the use of sticks, staffs other types of weaponary. A woman using a Bo staff to strike at a  projection of a humanoid figure caught his attention along with other people training with various similar weapons.

"You're you going to teach me how to fight like that?" Jim said In surprise.

" a non lethal attack is always preferable to the use of a projectile. They leave less mess and they stop you having to explain where you got an energy based weapon from"

"Makes sense" Jim said.


The next few weeks were like being back in basic training. Protocol Familiarisation, weapon training, genscript applications, Scenario after scenario after scenario. It felt to Jim that all he ever did was train.

# "A simple mission"
Jim walked up to the cave front. The surroundings were very and dull. All there was were rocks. Jim heard an explosion far away behind him. A few seconds later he heard another, then another. All getting closer reach time. The next explosion happened right behind him. They were mortar bombs. Jim ran in to the cave knowing that was the one place they couldn't land on him. Checking his armband he could see several exits to the cave. Jim then realised the bombing had stopped. He then realised the bombers knew he entered the cave. The cave path broke off in many directions only to join up further ahead. Running through the cave he voices behind him. They were not far behind.

Another blast hit ground, this time above him. The sound of cracks and rock movement could could be heard all around him. Jim looked up, then the cave collapsed on top of him.

A few seconds past. The rocks which had formed the cave around him which had now fallen on him began to chime a bright copper. The rocks and everything around him started to melt, flow around him and dispurse leaving a black room. The walls floors and ceiling were so dark you could not see how big the room really was. As Jim lay there sore and groaning he heard a slow clap in the distance. Billy started walking towards him. He offered a hand to pull him up. " not bad" billy said. " no one to date has ever completed the scenario 1st time, bit I have never seen anyone get that far on there 1st attempt before. Are you hurt? "

"No, just sore. The rocks are stoped before they crushed me but it didn't stop them from hitting me before I hit the ground" Jim said.

"Just be greatful this was only a simulation." Billy said

"So, what do I owe this visit too?" Jim asked

"I have a mission, a real mission, off-base. If your interested?" Replied billy

" are you kidding I was beginning to think I'd never get out of here." Jim said with a smile on his face.

# Briefing

Billy and Jim entered the briefing room. They were greeted by Elsa who was stamens by a wall with a projection of earth on it. " gentlemen... Please be seated " and said they joined Rodney and another strike team.

"A little over an hour ago a slow moving barge was travelling past sol. It was then realigned by several very powerful ships before we could intercept. We were forced to destroy the barge as it was on a direct course for earth however, before we we could next-door the barge it slot a projectile towards earth. It got past the vanishing point" Elsa started.

Jim looked over to billy and whispered "vanishing point?"

Billy replied "a distance from the earth. If Anything behind it we can refract the light  away from earth to avoid detection when the light reached earth. Anything past that point and we have detection problems."

Elsa continued her briefing. The protection behind her zoomed out to show a speed line around earth Indicating the vanishing point. The destroyed barge and projectile were positioned on the map.

"Given the size of the oh the object we believe it to be repurposed escape capsule. We are picking up 2 life signs on board. It is looking like some has gone to a lot of trouble to get on to earth. What for? We don't know. The capsule will look like a method hitting the earth so once it has crashed we will send in 2 teams. The 1st team will apprehend whoever is on that capsule. The 2nd team will clean up. Billy, take Jim and alpha to the crash site. Apprehend or guests and secure the site. Team 2 will join you once I have brief them. Jim.... It's time to see what you can do. Impact is in a little under 2 hours dismissed."

Jim followed billy out of the room. "Suit up for hostile confrontation meet in the portal bay in 1 hour" billy barked out keeping it short and simple.

Jim and alpha team barked out a collective "yes sir!". Doors opened in front of them. They all walked through to their destinations to prepare.

1 hour later..

Following a shower and change of clothing Jim walks into the portal room and is greeted by billy who was working on a plan on a table interface in the center of the room. "take a seat" billy says. 2 members of strike team alpha were already present. 2 were on there way.

Billy brought up a holographic display of the surface. the display showed pod as it entered the atmosphere. The remaining 2 strike team members enter the room. Billy stared counting down... "5 4 3 2 1... Alright, the pod has touched down In Peru. They will be somewhere in this area here" billy zooms into a specific reason on the map. " We will portal, separate into 3 groups. There will be drones establishing a spiral search pattern sending us areas on interest to investigate.. Any questions?, good Jim your with me" billy nodded to an engineer in the background. A portal opened up on the wall showing a 360° image on an area on the surface. Billy walked over to the wall and picked up a weapon syncing it to his equipment. above them 10 drones were fired through a tube into the top of the portal " let's move out" billy instructed. The 3 teams  walked I  1 straight line into the portal. When they emerged on the other side the globe shaped exit node pointed the team is the directions they were to search in. The drones shot out in all direcions refrating the light around them to ensure they could not be seen. When Jim looked back all he could see is what looked like a 2D picture of where they came from wrapped around a globe.

# Deployment

Billy and Jim walked along the established search trail. Billy saw a look on Jim's face of a man who had questions. "Is there something on your mind?" Billy asked. "Just a thought" Jim confessed. "Well go on" billy said.

"I'm curious to why you brought me along. Someone goes to all the trouble of launching a very large  armored ship who's purpose is to get a capsule on tho this planet. Out of all the skilled experienced people on that base you could have picked you chose someone barely out of training. This isn't exactly a simple mission." Jim explained

"there are no simple missions. We can simulate all day but in the end.. This is the best way to test" they slow down as they come to a cliff-face.  "did we walk off the search grid I done remember seeing this on the map?" Jim comments. " no and I don't remember seeing  this either" billy reviews the data he has on his arm scream. Jim looks closely at the cliff and puts his palm on it. "It's cold" he says.

"Oh I see what's going on here" billy realises. "Do me a favour and point your weapon at that all" billy continues to interface with his arm screen. " cloaking devices.. So easy to hack" billy boasts. A moment later the wall comes down to show a crashed pod and 2 alien lifeforms.

"Do not move!" Billy shouts out . One of them begins to run in the other direction while other grabs a device from his belt and raises it up in the air standing g his ground.

"What is that thing?" Jim asked

"It's a portal endpoint generator set to overload. That was his task to reach earth and create a beach-head. They could have sent an army through that. If it overloads us and everything around us will be dispersed into a void. He's buying time for he's pal."

Billy begins to transit a message ho the HUD on Jim's bio-board screen. 'I think we can disable the overload. I am sending modifications to your weapon. Once you receive the the upload shoot the device. That i think will destroy the device safely.'. The console on Jim's HUD logs the upload received successfully. He aims, and fires. Scream comes from the alien as the device explodes burning him and creating a field which explodes outwoods and  engulfs billy and Jim. Everything within the boost radius vanishes and is replaced with scortched earth.


# Rescue

**8 months ago.. Wilson farm**

A quiet barn erups into chos as everything in the blast radius in Peru gets thrown I to the barn in a massive explosion. The vegetation which got sucked though with them started to catch fire. The alien who was holding the device lay there and shreaked while on fire with one arm blown off. Billy got up feeling dazed." Well I did say ' think it will' "

Jim got up of the floor dazed, groggy and red from the surrounding heat and blast. Jim shook billy to wake him. The unsub was not that lucky. Holding the he was running around on fire. He looked around d and saw the same burning barn that went up in flames when he was rescued.  He now realized how the fire started.

Jim immediately freaked out looking around him. Sick got the better of his emotions. **"NO! HOW! WHY!"** Jim shouted processing what had just happened. He always billy in anger and went to grab him to find out exactly what was happening. A few hand to hand *grabs and blocks* were exchanged initiated by Jim before billy got a hot of him. Build looked him straight in the eyes and said "it there was any other way we would have done that. This is the only way none of us die! I will answer every question you have been at base but you know what happens next... Cloak!"

Simultaneously billy and Jim pulled their hood over their heads and vanished showing only the the smallest posts of their face. "Take this and get back" billy shouts handing him a breathing mask.

Present day Jim comes running in releasing horses out of their pens before the fire reaches them. He turns around to see the unsub burning  he pauses wondering what he is looking at. He took a few steps forward before the entrance collapses behind him trapping him in.

Smoke poured throughout in seconds suffocating present day Jim. He collapsed to the floor in seconds before anyone could do anything.


Back at the base billy was training Mike stick fighting on the mats in the training room. The illumination flickered above them. They both looked up in shock as this doesn't happen. They both activated their arm bands to see what was going on. Mikes band was operating without error showing no faults. Billy's flickered which grabbed mikes attention. This put a massive grin on Billy's face. Raising he had no control over any base operations he said to mike "get Mr to the portal room now!" Billy walked over to grab a gun before they both ran to the nearest point Mike could form a door. While running he interfaced with his bio-board to turn off all connectivity between him and the base.

Meanwhile in the portal bay the on duty crew picked up the activity in the barn. The on duty commander received offers over the tanoy from operations "we have detected a theta blast of unknown origin. Strike team Charlie prepare for immediate embarkation equip yourselves for hostile response and smoke inhalation" .
Strike team Charlie we the on duty emergency response team they dropped what they were doing and headed directly to the portal room with weapons and rebreathers. Within 30 seconds they were running into the portal room. The portal operator annotated their presence "gentlemen, activity beyond earth's current capability has been detected. We suspect outside interference. You are to deploy and identity the source of the theta blast and either confiscate of destroy the source of this. Apprehend anyone who is not meant to be there. The sentiment is filled with smile so wear your respirators at all times. Opening the portal".

Back in the barn future billy and Jim saw the portal open looking directly into the portal room. Billy sent a message to Jim's HUD ' on my mark, help me get you through the portal. Then sub down the strike team. They will meet be able to see you. I will deal with the automated defence turrets. Then file me out the door. You will have no control over the base..
...
...
Mark!'

Together and cleaned they grabbed present day Jim and started running forward the portal. In the portal room on a walkway on the 1st level a door opened. Billy and Mike came running through. Billy shouted oner the rails above them " hold your fire.. Friendlies inbound. As future billy and future Jim carried Jim in it caught the attention of the strike team. They turned to raise their weapons. Jim noticed this and raised his 1st Sunni g anyone with a weapon. Billy and Jim lay present day Jim on the ground and separated to soon anyone else remained. Present day billy looked down from above cursing to himself knowing the defences would shortly kick in. Billy pointed his weapon to the sensors in the ceiling and started taking them out. The automated defence turrets along the walls wrote up for a second before powering down.

Billy decloaks and looks alive him at himself. They both exchange a silent nod. Mike begins calling for medical units. Smoke continues to pour in through the portal Jim removed his hood and runs over to the portal console. Looking at it he realises it is all shot up, damaged by the shooting. The air conditioners kick In sucking the smoke out of the room however this on my draws in more smoke then it can extract. Jim raises his weapon and stars shooting the machinery around the portal. This shuts down the portal. The last of the smoke extracts out.

"This way, Stay cloaked" billy said opening and walking  through a door. Jim put his hood up again and followed him.

Billy matched into Elsa's office "it's happened. We have just had a type 16 paradox. we have been sent back 9 months.". "We?, Any fatalities?" Elsa asked. " none of ours, 1 unsub" billy said in a very quick and to the point tone.

Jim walks in behind billy decloacking. " you have some explaining to do! Why and how did that happen! And since when can we time travel? " Jim asked

"We cant. The technology is forbidden. There are incidents where other technologies have caused accidental temporal shifts." Said present day billy who came walking in with mike.

Elsa closed the door. looking to a blank wall to her right the call cascaded away similar to that of an opening door revealing a meeting room and table. "Everyone take a seat. Billy Explain what you can to us" Elsa said looking at future Billy. 

With everyone sat down billy started explaining what he could "9 Months ago in my time i was handed the genetically encrypted file". a text display appears on the wall full of encrypted text. "Unfortunately i am the only one who is able to read it due to the safeguards built into the file. In the beginning an attempt was made to access earth a part of earths time my a specialist team to correct an event level event caused by illegal external means. The beginning of this incident starts in my time. A group of unknown origin attempt to get 2 unsubs onto earth to develop a beachhead and portal in a team to extract precious resources from Earth these actions as profitable as they are cause the earth to before unsustainable. 

We were tracking 2 unsubs on the surface. 1 unsub fled the scene while another armed an explosive device in an attempt to disarm the explosive device the unsub was holding we caused the temporal shift which brought us here. The unsub was at the focal point of the explosion and got burnt to a crisp. we were a few meters away and got caught in the temporal wave it sent us back about 10 seconds after the unsub made it. At that point you detected the disturbance opened the portal and we came in."

"And the man left on the portal room floor?" Elsa asked.

"That's me, and that's my barn burning to the ground" Jim said.

"Well the good news is according to medical your present self is going to be fine after a few weeks of work, the bad new is we have no instant access to earth until the portal is fixed. So whats the next step?" Elsa asked knowing Billy had had months to consider his options. 

"Myself and Jim will need to go into stasis for the next 9 months until this incident repeats as we cant have 2 of us walking around like this. During that time i will need a small team, I suggest it be limited to people in this room, to review the data collected on the last incident and add it to the file i have with me. Maybe one day we can find action to take in this paradox." explained billy.

"Would it not be the same data as all the other times this has happened?" Jim asked.

"Unfortunately no, every time this happens the incident date is different. Therefore the actions are different. We don't know why yet but the same outcome happens every time at the moment. A lot of work has gone into this result we don't want to break the cycle of what is happening without an actionable plan considering previously mankind has been wiped out." billy suggested.

"Can i not go home? no one would know i was gone" Jim asked

"Can we have a moment in private?" Billy asked wanting to speak to Jim alone. everyone walked out of the room closing the door. Billy looked down at his arm display entering a few commands. The walls went black and billy began to glow. all lighting went off, All electronic functions went off. "I have disconnected everything from this room so we can truly talk in private but i can not keep the room in this state for long. I mentioned that the incident date of the capsule changes every time? that means there is an electronic or physical operative here now listening in. The more i divulge now the more things change." Billy Explained.

"This is why you told them it had been 9 months when it has only been 6 months?" Jim asked.

"Exactly. The circle has to be kept as small as possible. Right now the portal room is down so we have no access to earth apart from an ejection pod which could land you anywhere on the planet." With a gutted look on his face, Jim accepted what he was being told and nodded.

"I know how much you want to be with your family again and if we can find a way will will make that happen. For how we need to get you into status. i will handover what i have to the Billy in this time and join you shortly. We still have 1 unsub down there.. he will never see us coming. Explained Billy." Billy began to dim as the lighting and displays started to come back up.  

 Billy and Jim walked though a door when the wall was formed from the meeting room. "We need to go into status can you prepare 2 pods while i handover to your billy." Billy asked.

"we are already working on it" Elsa explained. I am having some food sent up there too. The door behind billy and jim opened up again except for this time into a corridor. "This way" Elsa said and started walking. Everyone followed.

Jim looked to Billy to start asking about what he was about to do "So you are going to freeze us, completely?"

"its not freezing. There are several different types of stasis depending on how long you plan to spend in it. In this type you will age about an hour for every week you are in there, hence the food now as you will come out hungry.

They walked into a room with a table in the middle and vertical pods along the walls.

Billy looked to Jim and held out his arm "grab my arm, i need to transfer the data your suit has over what happened so it can be analysed while we are in stasis." billy said.

Jim and billy grabbed each other forarms. This allowed Billy to transfer the data over to him that he needed 

"so its actually and hand.. over" Jim said looking down.

"Nice one, get some food while i give this to present day Billy" Billy replied. Jim walked over to the table of food and started eating.

Future Billy walked over to present day Billy. Present day Billy knew what was coming and extended his arm. They joined arms.

"messy stuff" Present day billy said.

"Very messy" Future billy replied Make sure you review everything i am giving you. Don't include anyone outside of this room on this. Find out who and whats doing this, and what technology specifically they are using. I will pick it up when i come out of stasis" Future Billy said

"Don't worry about it. its in the Safest hands possible.. yours" Present day Billy reminded him

They let go of each other. Future billy deactivated his connection to the base. His interfaces turned off. " you should be able to connect again now" Future Billy said to Present day Billy.

Present day Billy looked at his arm display as it lit up. "Everything looks good, see you in a few months" he said.

Future Billy Turned around to notice Jim getting up from the table "Ready?" he asked?

"I Guess, Have you done this before?" Jim asked.

"A few times" Future Billy replied. he nodded to his younger self who lowered a pod from vertical standing to horizontal standing. The pod opened.

The pod was a long rectangular box with a semi circle door. The bottom of the pod was lined with a think gel. "whats in there?" jim asked.

"That keeps you hydrated among other things" billy replied.

Jim climbed into the pod and lay down on the open semi circular doors.

Billy looked down at him "Thank you for trusting me with this, a lot of people would not have taken it as well as you have. You've done well, better then i could have imagined."

With that Billy nodded to his younger self. The doors to the pod began to rotate and close.Jim fell into the suspension gel hitting the bottom of the pod. The pod then moved back into its vertical position. Jim looked out of the pod as it frosted over a bright white.


# Debrief

As quickly at the pod frosted over it Defrosted. For Jim no time had past. He looked up to see Mike looking down. Jim was feeling a little distorted but could hear mike trying to assess his conciseness. In the background he could get billy bringing himself out of state. "wake up you beautiful man you" Jim could hear coming from the other pod. Jim pulled him self up and sat in the pod wiping the gel from his face then from over this body where he could.

"Good Morning Gentlemen" Elsa asid standing in between the pods.
Billy sat up in his pod "I assume everything is in play" he said to his other self. Present day billy put his arm against his other selfs arm now he was sitting up in his pod..

"Analysis is almost complete however its beginning." said billy transferring the updated file back to his other self. "I need to get going if i'm going to get to the surface." said present day Billy. Billy nodded from his pod. Present day billy walked out of the room to prepare going to the surface.

Elsa continued her briefing. "Jim, we had to sever you connection to the base as there are now 2 of you. Hopefully if all goes according to plan we will be able to reconnect you soon. We have prepared and area for the both of you to refresh yourself s. Once that is done mike will take you to an area we have prepared for you to monitor this operation and carry on with what you need to do."

Billy and Jim followed Mike through a door he opened leading to room with 2 shower compartments, a small dining area with prepared food and a door at the other end of the room. " Clean the gel off your head and clothing, grab some food and follow me when your done." Mike said walking through the door at the other end of the room leaving it open. Jim and Billy proceeded to do exactly that. Instead of walking into a level corridor Jim and Billy walked up a long ramp into a dark room.

"What is this place?" JIm asked.
"This is what i built to manage this operation and analyse the data we retrieved before bringing you up here. This is a stealth room. it is shielded from everywhere else to avoid detection. hence the pitch backup walls." Walking to the center of the room there was a lage sphere suspended from the ceiling. the lower portion of the sphere had data and analytics passing by. The rest of the globe including under the analytics was displaying the capsule headed towards earth. under the globe the floor curved downwards to allow walking under the globe. Mike was at a console to the side feeding data to Billy in the portal room. The room also contained a mini-armory, various power generation units, and other equipment.

On the globe you could see billy in the portal room receiving instructions from mike. Billy activated a console reviewing the data left for him confirming it matched up with the data left for him last cycle. It matched. " Gear up Jim, were going back down" billy instructed. Mike proceeded to the armoury getting ready to return to the planet.

" If unsub 2 is armed with the same tech as unsub 1 how do you to bring him in? Plan A didn't exactly with as we hoped." Mike asked. Billy continues to review the data presented. A grin be on his face " I have an idea or 2" billy replied configuring a new firing mode. " Pass me a rifle" billy asked. Mike walked over to the wall of rifles in the armoury and picked one up passing it to billy. He places it onto the console. Billy then uploads the new firing pattern to the rifle. "Mike can you authorise this pattern please. " Billy asked

" Done" mike replied nodding his head reading over the pattern on his eye-hud. 

Billy could see that his other self had just opened the portal and was getting ready to head out. Mike saw billy nod in the portal room and dispatched the drones. As the drones began to circle around the crash site the data was transmitted back. The curved floor under the display globe began to illuminate and display a overview of the ground from above. Looking down you can clearly see the crash two of the capsule. Billy sent the location of the end of the trail to himself on the surface.

Billy zoomed in to the crash site. He and Jim walked over to the location on the floor display to plan the next step. Establishing what the took the cloak down they were able to identify the direction three 2nd unsub was running in. Billy spotted a clearing a little further along the path where they could portal down. "Mike relieve the portal engineer and lock in this location for deployment." Billy ordered.

"Yes sir" mike replied leaving his console walking out off the room into the portal room. On the display globe mike can be seen taking control of the portal room console.

Billy walks over to the armoury to collect the last of his equipment attaching an arm display. "So here's the plan. Once were sent back we will be able to reconnect ourselfs to the base. Sync up your equipment. We will head direct to the portal room. The portal will be open. We will head straight through. The remaining unsub will think we are dead.. He will have seen us all come though the portal and the explosion. He will not see us coming. At that point we will bring him up for questioning." Mike said

"Sounds simple enough" Jim replied.

The display below then changed to show a small black scorched circle and the remaining strike teams running towards it. Billy looked at Jim. "Now!" He said. Running towards the door billy and Jim reconnected themselves to the base. They opened the door exiting into the back of the portal room.  The team on the surface can be heard reporting in "base.. billy and Jim have been incinerated. There gone! Please advise". Mike replied "strike team please await further instructions... out"

Billy and Jim continue to run through directly into the portal. As planned 50 metres in front of them they run into the unsub running straight towards them.

Billy and Jim both raise their rifles "STOP RIGHT THERE DO NOT MOVE, DO NOT MOVE! GET DOWN ON THE GROUND" Jim shouts.
The unsub reaches for a device on his belt just as his colleague did previously. Before he could grab it billy shoots the unsubs elbow. The elbow and half the forearm was vaporised. The unsub screened in pain as the rest of his forearm and hand dropped to the ground.

"Feel free to try that with the other hand... I have plenty of ammo" billy said

"That was you revised plan?" Jim asked

Billy replied looking down his rifle not taking his eyes off the unsub "yep"

"Isn't that a bit extreme taking his arm?" Jim asked

"It will grow back" billy replied showing no emotion in his voice.

Signaled by mike the strike team met up with billy and Jim. " Disarm it and take it in" billy ordered in a very stern tone.

Breaking is silence the unsub broke is silence. " How do you live?" It asked after seeing the crash site including, including everything in that crash site incinerate.

# Capture

"So Lucy, what is it then?" Jim asked looking down at table analyzing the device the Unsub tried to grab prior to capture. He was in a lab back at the base trying to figure out exactly what technology is in use hoping to answer some questions about where the usub what from.

"Actually its two. The Bottom half is a shield generator. The top half is the explosive device. It is designed to protect whoever is under it while destroying anything within a few Metres."

"So when we shot the 1st one..." Jim started

"You took that out before it could be deployed. I am detecting temporal elements. Probably to ensure the shield is fully generated prior to the blast going off at the same time and keeping the shield at full power for as long as the device has the power to do so. Instant recharge, i like it" Lucy finished.

"you figured all that out? I thought this technology was banned?" Jim asked

"Time is a dimension. To understand the others you need to have some understanding of this. Yes the ability to move though time is mostly classified science throughout the 3 major civilizations there still needs to be a small level of understanding to allow use of other dimensions, like this one. This also doesn't stop pirate factions trying to accomplish this however if anyone did try to break any galactic restrictions from outside the 3 major civilizations action would be taken to stop them immediately. We are only a small low-tech outpost so i cant tell you much more then this. We will be sending this item along with the prisoner for better analysis." Lucy concluded.

"Low tech eh?" Jim replied starting to walk out of the room "This place looks a lot more advanced then that to me" he concluded trying not to imagine what they actually consider advanced tech. Jim walked out of the Lab in to a detention Facility. "and now to figure out who he is" Jim said walking over to Billy. "Hes a he right?" Jim asked.

"Biologically yes" billy replied. "Hes from a 2 genderspecies and fits the definition of a male. Hes not saying much" Billy said looking to the screen showing the prisoner restrained. All remaining limbs were shackled. He was roped up suspended in the air.

"Isn't this a bit extreme" Jim asked looking at how many ways they had restrained him and the amount of guards they had surrounding him.

"We know what species he is now. Trust me this is needed."

The unsub screamed trying to pull the the restraints while the guards tasered him back trying to detour him from trying to escape from his restraints.

Billed tuned to storage area behind the projection picking up a satchel filling it with equipment. Jim enlarged the the projection on the wall looking down at who had destroyed his life. "I have some interrogation experience. Mind if i give it a go?" Jim asked keeping his eyes on the screen.

"Be my guest. I have some bugs to zap!" Billy replied walking out of the room. Jim followed behind him walking into the main detention area. Billy quietly opened his satchel pulling out a scanning device walking around the room.

Jim walked up to The Unsub looking him right in the eyes.

"You..." The Unsub breathed in a deep voice. A look of shock was on the guards both in the room and in the observation room. Two of the guards looked at each other in the observation room "It was the 1st word he had said since he got here" one of them asked. the 2nd guard nodded.

"So your talking now? what changed?" Jim asked without reacting to his break of silence.

The unsub went back to being silent. "What were you doing on earth?" Jim asked. The unsub remained silent. "I will ask you again... what were you doing on earth?" Jim asked again. He was met with silence. Jim to one more step forward and looked the unsub right in the eyes. "Let me put this into perspective for you. Thanks to your incursion earth considers me dead so I have all the time in the world.. I guess I should have said galaxy. How much of your life do you want to spend striped to your skin, suspended in mid air, eating through a straw, and urinating down you legs?" Jim asked. Again Jim was met with silence. Jim took one final look into the unsubs eyes and walked walked away. When allowing the door he said to the commanding guard "I'm going back in to stasis. Same me up when he's ready to talk"

"Yes sir" replied the guard.

"You kill brer then string me up like an animal and expect me to talk?" the unsub shouts. Jim Pauses and turns around re-entering the room. "You see that wasnt so hard was it? who's brer?"

"It means brother, his brother died back on earth before we captured him." Billy said from behind the unsub while scanning the room.

"why were you there?" Jim asked

"you call it a foothold" the unsub said

"the portal technology. you wanted to bring in an army, why?" just replied

"i didnt ask" the unsub replied.

"Ask who?" Jim asked

"Do what you want with me, i will not be held forever. This i promise, when i'm out i'm coming for you and everyone you care for. your mother your father your children their chil.... arghhhhh" the unsub screamed out in agony. behind him Billy had dug his knife in the unsubs back cutting down.

"ah i knew it!" billy said. hi put his hand inside the incision and pulled out a device. "Bingo! the bug" he said walking away looking at the device.

"Jim, a word please" Jim turned around to see Elsa walking in. Jim followed her out of the room.

# Transfer

Elsa and Jim walked into the observation room. "Orders have come in, were moving the unsub to Titan, its a moon orbiting Saturn we have a base on. My superiors don't want him this close to earth. A ship is being sent to pick collect him. He will remain on titan until then. Strike team Echo are preparing to transport the prisoner."

"I want to go with them" jim said. "For some reason i am the only one he is talking too and he knows something about me, i do not know what yet and i do not understand what it could be."

Elsa looked up at Jim. "I saw what he said and i thought you might. Pack a bag you have 30 minutes."

Billy walked in. "Were bugged!" he said holding up the device he pulled out the unsub. its a transceiver. I have already found one other on this base and it is still transmitting out. there are others. who knows how long they have been here."


"What is it?" Billy asked Lucy. They were back in the lab with with Jim and Elsa. The device was virtualized and projected in front of them.
"I'm not sure" Lucy replied." It resembles what we use to establish links with other bases crossing the differential threshold. This technology is not meant to be in civilian hands." People lines began to emit from the projected device.
"What are those?" Jim asked.
"Connections... Individual connections. I am not sure where to." Lucy replied.

"Can you block them?" Elsa asked?

"Done. that will block it for now until something more permanent can be set up. Only one of those connections war going out of the base. The rest were connected inside this facility." Lucy replied

"So there are more." Billy summarized.

"Get rid of them, get us upgraded, and have the systems audited... In that order" Elsa ordered. Billy nodded and walked out.

Elsa activated her comm. "Mike can you join us please". Elsa looked to Jim. "We are comprised. The prisoner can't remain here."

"The prisoner knows more then he is letting on. About me, about us, and what he was doing here. I want to see this through to the end. Jim said.

A door formed. Mike walked through it into the room walking to Elsa. "We are moving the prisoner to Titan. Have your team prepare to move out in 1 hour. Prepare to remain with him for now. I intend to have it under heavy guard until he can be collected and taken out of this system."Elsa said.
"I'm a man down. The prisoner the commanding against a wall while we were securing him. The doc says he will pull through." Mike replied.
"I'm assigning Jim to you for this mission. Here's proven himself" Elsa replied.
" I couldn't agree more" Mike replied.
Elsa faced both Jim and Mike. "Prepare to head out in 30 mins."

Jim entered a Detention area suited up for Combat to meet up with Mike and the rest of his team. Jim walked up to mike. " So what and where is Titan?" Jim asked.

"Titan is a moon orbiting Saturn . It's the main port in and out of this system. It is out of portal range. To get there we will have to transit out." Multiple strike teams were surrounding the prisoner applying restraints and a metal collar so it could be controlled from a distance with a metal pole. "I have just received word. the transit area has been cleared" Mike said.

In front of them a large door formed opening another large area full of seating and display panels along the wall. "Is this your first time using the transit?" Mike asked.

"yep.. first time" Jim replied as they walked in to the transit waiting room. The teams followed with the prisoner surrounded.

Mike began barking orders out. "OK Alpha and bravo and Echo teams you are with me." As the door behind them closed another opened in front of them. this room was circular with a long tall semi circular tube propelling anything in it outwards.

The teams surrounding the prisoner walk forward in the the tube propelling them through.

# Epilogue

On a cold dark and stormy rocky planet 2 parties met. Alien in origin and from different species one of them pulls down their hood and speaks "They Failed. One of them self-terminated upon capture as contracted. The brother Itch failed to do so. They have captured him. We do not know where they are holding him. He knows more then he should. If he talks it will end everything we are trying to achieve."

 The leader of the other party stepped forward. "Their kind do not talk easily. Thats why we chose them. Itch will be retrieved when we have the opportunity. then we will know what they know. Do you know how they were captured?"

The 1st leader replied "We have this" displaying a holographic recording of the capture

"Who are these Agents?" asked the 2nd leader. The recording specifically focused on billy Jim and mike.

"We are unsure. they do not exist on any record we obtained" replied the 1st leader.

The 2nd leader studied the recording then replied "Find out who they are. I will deal with them myself"
